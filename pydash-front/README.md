## Building and running

We recommend using `yarn` for package management because it is safer and faster than using `npm` itself.
Installing the dependencies is done using the command `yarn` (`yarn install`).

Running in development can then be done using `yarn start`. This will re-compile the application whenever source is changed. It mounts the app on `localhost:3000`.
To build the front-end application for production, use `yarn build`.

## For Developers

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebookincubator/create-react-app); more documentation about how to use React and `create-react-app` specifically can be found there.
